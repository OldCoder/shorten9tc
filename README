shorten9tc notes                                       Revised: 120704
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Overview.

"shorten9tc"  is a simple Firefox extension that serves primarily as a
well-commented example of a  minimal right-click extension;  i.e.,  an
extension that does something useful when the  user  right-clicks on a
link or an image (or in empty space on a page).

Languages used include JavaScript (for the actual code) and  XML  (for
RDF and  XUL files). The project provides  source files and  a "build"
script.  The "build" script produces a standard  XPI file that is com-
patible with Firefox 3.6 through 12.

"shorten9tc"  is a fork of "Shorten URL" by homyarb.  Both  extensions
add right-click functionality for links displayed by a browser; speci-
fically, they run links through a URL-shortening service and optional-
ly submit the results to social networking sites.

Most of the "Shorten URL" code in  "shorten9tc" has been removed,  re-
written, and/or commented.  This version is  limited  in functionality
but should be useful for  developers  starting out with Firefox exten-
sions and/or JavaScript.

By  default,  "shorten9tc"  uses a particular  URL-shortening  service
named "9.tc".  As of July 4, 2012, the date this version was released,
both the service and the extension were  working for  basic shortening
purposes.

Social networking submissions were tested previously  but not retested
on this date.

Presently, this extension is for Firefox only. However, it could prob-
ably be made to work with other Mozilla-based browsers.

"shorten9tc" was created by OldCoder:

      Site:    http://oldcoder.org/
      Mail:    oldcoder@yahoo.com
      GitHub:  https://github.com/OldCoder/
      Repo:    https://github.com/OldCoder/BEWorld.git

The license is GPL 3;  the same as "Shorten URL's" license  as of July
4, 2012.

2. History.

Remarks by the initial developer (OldCoder):

As of 2010, hat0 of the Brick Engine project ran a URL shortening ser-
vice at "9.tc".  He expressed interest in  seeing how a Firefox exten-
sion that used "9.tc"  might work,  so I forked the standard  "Shorten
URL" extension and created a new version that supported his site.

As of 2012, the "9.tc" service was still operating.  Whether or not it
continues to operate indefinitely, the  source code  for the extension
may be useful as discussed previously.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Usage.

3.1. This extension provides basic support for "9.tc" operations,  in-
cluding:

      (a) Shorten URL and copy to clipboard
      (b) Shorten URL and send to Email
      (c) Shorten URL and send to Facebook
      (d) Shorten URL and send to FriendFeed
      (e) Shorten URL and send to Twitter

In most cases,  it should be  relatively easy to add support for other
social networking sites.

3.2. After the extension is installed,  you  should be able to  use it
as follows:

(a) Go to a web page and right click in  unused space.  Or right-click
on a link. Or right-click on an image.

(b) In the context menu,  you should see a list of commands related to
"9.tc". If you execute one of the commands, it'll be performed for the
current page,  or for  the selected link  (if you  right-clicked  on a
link), or for the selected image (if you right-clicked on an image).

3.3. Toolbar icons are provided for each "9.tc" operation (shorten URL
and Twitter,  shorten URL and  email, etc.).  By  default,  the  icons
aren't added to any toolbars.  If you'd like to add them, use the fol-
lowing window (or the equivalent one in your copy of Firefox):

      View -> Toolbars -> Customize

3.4. Presently,  the  icons are very simple  (just text).  However, it
should be easy to replace them with new versions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Development.

4.1. Source code.

Full source code for  the extension is  provided in  the  subdirectory
"source" of the project's GitHub repo.  It's  also included in the XPI
file, though you'll need to unpack the  ".jar" file  that's  stored in
one subdirectory to get at some of it.

4.2. Tools.

If you'd like to work on the extension,  Linux is recommended.  You'll
probably need at least the following tools:

unzip: To unpack the extension's ".xpi" file.
zip:   To repack the extension's ".xpi" file.

jar (or fastjar): To unpack and repack a  ".jar" file  included in the
extension.

uuidgen -- To generate new UUID codes.

4.3. Three important steps.

If you  fork this extension to  create your own,  remember to do three
things:

      (a) Use "uuidgen" (under Linux) to generate a new UUID code
      (b) Edit "install.rdf" and update the UUID code
      (c) Change the extension name (in "install.rdf") as well

4.4. Firefox version.

The minimum  Firefox version  supported is presently set to 3.6.  How-
ever, older versions might work. If you'd like to try them, change the
minimum-version  setting specified  in the  extension's  "install.rdf"
file.

For more information about Firefox version numbers, see:

      https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/pages/appversions/

4.5. Rebuilding the XPI file.

To rebuild the XPI file,  simply go to the directory that contains the
script "buildme.sh" and run the script there.
